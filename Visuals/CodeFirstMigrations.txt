Run the Enable-Migrations command in Package Manager Console
Add-Migration will scaffold the next migration based on changes you have made to your model since the last migration was created
Update-Database will apply any pending migrations to the database


I enabled automatic migrations by using a switch in the Enable-Migrations command:
	Enable-Migrations -EnableAutomaticMigrations

My migration was called AddHtmlElements
	Add-Migration AddHtmlElements

I used the verbose switch to see what was going on
	Update-Database -Verbose

I got the error: System.Data.SqlServerCe.SqlCeException (0x80004005): The data was truncated while converting from one data type to another. [ Name of function(if known) =  ]
I saw that the last sql command ran had to do with the Sessions.Title attribute.
I read: http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/adonetefx/thread/7e1339d6-203d-4687-a1dc-244643734526
I thought the problem was with the length of the Sessions.Title attribute so I changed
		
		[Required, MaxLength(50)]
		public string Title { get; set; }
to
		[Required, MaxLength(100)]
        public string Title { get; set; }

I ran:

1) Enable-Migrations -EnableAutomaticMigrations
2) Add-Migration AddHtmlElements
3) Update-Database -Verbose
